#  Conversion

I converted the data using excel and then used the multi-line cursor to clean further in sublime text. I changed some date formatting with regex. Here were my steps from getting from `Data_Feed.csv` to `data.csv`

1. I did this first
2. Then I did this
3. Finally, thisI truncated Data_Feed.csv since it was big for the sake of this example
That is also not the real data source, just an example
